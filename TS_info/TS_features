TYPESCRIPT 

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript
- Adds static typing to JS
- Catch errors early with static typing
- Improve code readabilty and maintainability
- Better support for large scale projects

JAVASCRIPT PROGRAMMING

- Dynamically typed, allows variables to change types at runtime
- Interpreted language that runs without prior compilation (source code is converted to binary code during runtme)
- Error are typically caught at runtime
- Less mantainable in large projects (no Type Safety)
- Does not fully support all OOP principles (JS is Prorotype programmng language)
- Access modifiers: no explicit access modifiers, properties are public by default

TYPESCRIPT PROGRAMMING

- Statically typed, enables type checking at compile time, which helps catch errors early.
- Compiled language that needs to be compiled into JS before execution 
- Error are caught at compile time (reduces runtime errors and improves code reliability)
- Improves mantainability and readabilty , especiallt in large codebases (Type Safety)
- Supports all OOP principles
- Access modifiers: public, protected, private
